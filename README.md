# Surbri

Have you ever wished for a tool that would keep an eye on your microservice project dependencies across the services to discover critical vulnerabilities?  
And once those are discovered, it would try to upgrade the dependencies to the latest version and run the test suits you have to define whether the upgrade will break anything?  
Maybe it would also be great if, assuming the upgrades don't make any new tests fail, it would automatically create a build with those for you to test manually and approve?  
*Surbri* doesn't do anything of that. It's a self-hosted Secret Santa service with Telegram integration.
